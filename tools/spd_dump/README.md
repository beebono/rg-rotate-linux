# spd_dump_it
so this is the close-source spd_dump, the open-source one will keep achieved.

### [Prebuilt Program for Windows](https://nightly.link/TomKing062/action_spd_dump_it/workflows/build/main)

### [Prebuilt Program for Linux](https://nightly.link/TomKing062/action_spd_dump_it/workflows/build-musl/main)

## Note

if you use spd_dump with auto-unlock-batches, download oldpath version.

### New Commands

* [Command] `sendcmd type file` (250921)

  * supports "type-only" mode
  * if file exists: auto-fill data and length
  * can execute even if file does not exist

* [Command] `sendpack file` (250921)

  * format: `(7e type length data crc 7e)`
  * requires file

* [Command] `rawpack file` (250921)

  * format: `(type length data [ignored-crc])`
  * CRC and transcode handled internally
  * requires file

* [Command] `dis_avb` (251013, 260108)

   ex: `dis_avb_ex sml_or_teecfg tos`, which saves to tos-noavb-bsp-bypassed (not flash to device directly)

   [read here for more info about dis_avb](https://github.com/TomKing062/unisoc_chipram_signcheck_exploit)

   * [Change] update `gen_tos` algorithm used in dis_avb (251104, 260109)

* [Command] `mergenv-xml xml new_nv` (251211)

   ex: `mergenv-xml-ex xml old_nv new_nv`, which saves to tmp/nvmerged (not flash to device directly)

* [Command] `mergenv-cfg cfg new_nv` (251211)

   ex: `mergenv-cfg-ex cfg old_nv new_nv`, which saves to tmp/nvmerged (not flash to device directly)

* [Command] `g_w_force 0/1` to control `w_force` (260108)

* [Command] `pac PAC_FILE` (support flashing PAC firmware, main branch only) (260222)

   * fix crush when flashing PAC in SPRD4 (260521)

Supported forms:

```
spd_dump pac <PAC> reset
spd_dump exec_addr <addr> pac <PAC> reset
spd_dump exec_addr <addr> fdl <fdl1> <addr1> fdl <fdl2> <addr2> exec pac <PAC> reset
```

Notes:

* supports custom FDL during flashing
* only supports **partname-based partition table** (UBIFS / GPT)
* legacy **ID-based (RDA) table** not supported
* region/OCDT selection (e.g. OPPO/Realme PAC) not supported
